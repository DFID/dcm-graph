# DCM Graph

This repository is created to store a research work for visualising delivery chain map based on [IATI store data](https://iati.cloud) and [neo4j graph database](https://neo4j.com).

## About DCM Graph
Our main goal for this project is to create a prototype Graph Database of International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)1 data in establishing a connection between DFID and a supplier of interest beyond immediate project funding. To do this, we have prepared a python script to import data from the [IATI store](https://iati.cloud) and prepare the necessary CSV files of Nodes and relationships for importing into a neo4j instance.
